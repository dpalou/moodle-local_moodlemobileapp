# Moodle App plugin

*This repository is mostly auto-generated*

This plugin contains some developer tools that are not interesting for anybody but Moodle App developers at Moodle HQ.

Do not install this plugin at your Moodle installation, it won't do anything. If you have already installed, it is safe to be removed.

It currently contains:
 * Moodle App Translation files that are used to publish new strings to AMOS. More information here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=252704
 * Language packs for the App translated to json, so it can be included into the app easily.
 * TypeScript structure of WS params and returns used by to App, in the structure folder.
 * Scripts and github actions to do some magic.

Notice: Tests have been moved to the App.
